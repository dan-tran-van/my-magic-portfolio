# Torangu (Trang tranh)

## Overview

Torangu (international name for _Trang tranh_) is a full-stack social media platform focused on **advanced international typography and layout systems**, with first-class support for both **vertical and horizontal writing modes**. The project explores how modern frontend architecture can support complex, multilingual user interfaces while remaining scalable and maintainable.

The platform is built using **Next.js and React** on the frontend and **Django REST Framework** on the backend, following an API-driven approach suitable for long-term product growth.

## Key Features

- **Internationalized Layout System**  
  Dynamic support for horizontal and vertical writing modes (`horizontal-tb`, `vertical-rl`, `vertical-lr`) using CSS logical properties. Layout direction can be switched at the component level without duplicating styles.

- **Component-Based Frontend Architecture**  
  Reusable and scalable UI components built with React and TypeScript, enabling consistent behavior and faster iteration across the application.

- **Responsive and Accessible UI**  
  Interfaces designed to adapt across screen sizes while maintaining readability and usability across different writing directions and languages.

- **Complex User Interaction Handling**  
  Implementation of interactive features such as content creation, feeds, and profile views, with careful management of UI state and transitions.

- **Performance and SEO Optimization**  
  Leveraged Next.js App Router and server-side rendering (SSR) to improve performance, SEO, and initial load time.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router)** – Server-side rendering, routing, and performance optimization
- **React and TypeScript** – Component-based UI development with strong type safety
- **SCSS Modules** – Modular styling with CSS logical properties for international layouts
- **Django REST Framework** – API-driven backend for authentication and content management
- **MySQL and Redis** – Data storage and caching
- **Vercel** – Frontend deployment and preview environments

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was designing a layout system that could gracefully support **non-Latin writing systems**, particularly vertical text used in Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Mongolian scripts. Many common CSS patterns assume left-to-right, horizontal layouts, which required rethinking spacing, alignment, and component structure.

By adopting **CSS logical properties** and building layout-agnostic components, the frontend became significantly more flexible and future-proof. Another key learning was balancing flexibility with maintainability, ensuring components remained reusable while still supporting complex layout variations.

This project also reinforced the importance of **clean frontend architecture** as UI complexity increases and product requirements evolve.

## Outcome

Torangu is currently in preparation for launch, featuring a scalable frontend architecture capable of supporting diverse languages and complex user interactions. The project demonstrates practical experience in building **production-ready frontend systems**, translating product requirements into robust UI solutions, and continuously iterating on performance and usability.

It serves as both a functional product and a case study in advanced frontend engineering for internationalized applications.
